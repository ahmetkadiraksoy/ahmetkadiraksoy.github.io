I'm **Dr. Ahmet Aksoy**, an Associate Professor in Cybersecurity and Director of the [NetML Lab](https://netml.github.io/), where I lead research at the intersection of **network forensics**, **AI-driven threat detection**, and **IoT security**.

My work focuses on developing intelligent systems for identifying malicious network behavior, fingerprinting IoT devices, and enhancing explainability in cybersecurity through AI models. I‚Äôve published peer-reviewed research in areas such as traffic classification, SHAP-based explainable AI, and optimization-driven feature selection.

## üß† Research Meets Practice

While my academic foundation is strong, I‚Äôm equally passionate about **real-world application**. This blog is where I share:

- Practical guides on tools like **Zeek**, **tcpdump**, and **jq**
- Insights on **network security monitoring**, **incident analysis**, and **AI in security**
- Reflections on building better bridges between **research and operations**
